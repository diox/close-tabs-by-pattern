Browser extension adding a button that automatically closes tabs whose URL
match specific patterns

Originally built as a way for tab hoarders like me to quickly close
work-related tabs that have accumulated during the week before going on PTO
or week-end.

Example usage:

- Open the add-on preferences page, and add a pattern for `*://github.com/*`.
- Click the button, and all tabs from Github should automatically be closed.

Pinned tabs are excluded, and patterns should be synchronized across multiple
devices.
